# left-rotation-by-d-places
 A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. Given an integer, d, rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.  Example: d=2 arr=[1,2,3,4,5] After 2 rotations, arr'=[3,4,5,1,2]  Sample Input 5 4 1 2 3 4 5  Sample Output 5 1 2 3 4  Explanation  To perform d=4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes: [1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]->[3,4,5,1,2]->[4,5,1,2,3]->[5,1,2,3,4]
